AEE Introduction (1/2)
.What is AEE?
–Android Exception Engine (AEE) Feature is an exception catching
and debugging information generation mechanism.
.Basic terminology & definition
–Exceptions are typically used to signal that something went wrong
or abnormal (e.g. a division by zero occurred, memory access
violation, undefined instruction). We consider those exceptions
crashing the system

Mobile log
.
This is a tool which could get AP
Log(Main/Radio/ BT/Event/Kernel log)
. Steps of start the mobile log ICS version can only be saved on the SD card
–
The default position=mnt/sdcard/mtklog/mobilelog
. /Data/mobilelog
–
Type the log size, default is 300MB (The total log size)
–
Configure or disable auto run
–
Click the start button
.
Then you can leave the process and it will run on background
.
Notifications on the top bar indicate the status of mobile log

Which kind of Log we should not use MobileLog?
–
In fact, any tool has its limitations, there are some cases which they
can not record logs
Phone hang

Can record nothing

Copyright .

Suspend log

Can.t record suspend log

Depends the up the Log at The ON the Boot Number The of logs, IT May Loose at The Beginning log
Shutdown the Log Can.t the Record All the shutdown log
UMS Can.t Work at The Mounted sdcard IF IS Used to Store the Log
MobileLog
stop to clear the log, is strongly
proposed in Clear log before verifying the problem

Mobilelog logger (2/2)
. User build cannot grab the kernel log via usb
. When the kernel fails to restart, the kernel panic log cannot be obtained
. Time for different types of logs Inconsistent stamps?
-The timestamps at the beginning of the log are inconsistent (MobileLog use a rotate mechanism. The oldest Log might be overwrite
by new arrived)
. To control the Log size, Log files recorded by MobileLog are limited to 5 files at maximum, and the
size of each file is computed by total size and how many Log type should be record
. If one log file reach its size, then rename it to “*.1”, and original “*.1” turn to “*.2”, and so on. The
original “*.4” will be deleted
– the timestamp at the end of the log is inconsistent (the last log is lost)
. It may be the case that user does not stop the tool, there are still some logs in buffer and did not
flush to sdcard
. “main_log.boot”和“main_log.4”时间戳差很大?
– main_log.boot is a independent file which record the log during boot up, it will not be overwritten
like main_log.4
.如何知道log已经停止录制?
– If the user did not stop MobileLog and pull log directly, the size of all *_log will seem to be 1KB or
very close to the integer multiples of 64KB, which is the buffer size of MobileLog
. Log有乱码?
– This case may be happen if there suffer some Sdcard issues
. Content of other files appear in log file
. There a lot of wrong characters in log file (may be content of binary file or image)

Modemlog logger (1/2).
Modem Log is the Log generated by the Modem, which is the Cather
Log in the FP
– Modem log is a binary format log. It cannot be opened and viewed directly. It needs MTK
's catcher tool to view.
It support 2 ways of logging: SD logging and USB
logging
–In SD logging mode, it records modem logs in SD card
files
–In USB logging mode, it relays modem logs to PC Catcher
via USB connection
.Steps of start the modem log
–position=mnt/sdcard/mtklog/mdlog
–Type the log size: 1GB/600MB/stop until sd full (The total
log size)
– Configure or disable auto run
–Click the start button
.Notifications on the top bar indicate the status of
modem log .How
to be in the idle state
-enter the modem log, cancel the automatic startup after booting, and restart the phone.
Users can open .dmp files by Catcher.
Only in the idle state
can the mode be switched to

Modemlog logger (2/2)
. Log folder
– every time After powering on or after MDLogger pause and resume, a new folder will be opened
– the reason for the large log size: the commonality of telephony problems. When problems are found, the time point for possible problems has been a long time, a typical
case It is the problem of register network reject. When the network rejects, it may appear in the middle of the night. When you wake up in the morning and cannot register to the network
, the LOG has already been flushed
– Memory Dump
. Name such as Memory_PS_2010_0916_171003.bin
. After memory dump is done, a dialog will be popped up to inform users that memory dump is finished (Click “OK” would
reset Modem and MDLogger)
. Recycling
– MDLogger will check current every 30 seconds size
. If the remaining space is less than 5MB, the log deletion mechanism will be activated
. The standard for each log deletion is to clear the space greater than 10MB
. Priority is to delete all non-Modem log Folders -> delete the Folder without EE (but if the bin file will Keep the db files needed by bin and catcher) -> delete
some log files in the recorded folder (will be retained) -> delete EE (keep db and bin) -> delete EE folder
-Note
. Set 600M or 1G Mode, but if the SD Card memory is not enough free, the Modem tool will stop first when the
SD Card is full, and the Modem Log will not be deleted because the SD Card is full
. Filter file
– Modem need a filter file to output specific log:
. So “catcher_filter.bin” (the generation method will be introduced later) is must for SD mode
– ModemLog will search the filter file in the following path in order:
. /sdcard/mtklog/mdlog/catcher_filter.bin
. /system/etc/firmware/catcher_filter.bin (default in load)
– Set custom filter
. push the filter file into the folder: /sdcard/mtklog/mdlog/
. Please reboot the target if catcher_filter.bin is updated by adb pushMEDIATEK CONFIDENTIALFOR yuqing.zhang@ ck-telecom.com USE

Network Diagnose Tool
. Objective
– Since many networking issues are difficult to reproduce. When the issue happens, This
tool can get enough networking information for resolving networking issue
. This tool can get so many networking information
– Networking information in proc folder
– NIC information
– the default routing and dns server
– tcpdump Log
– ping Log
. Log position
– mnt/sdcard/mtklog/netlog
. This UI as shown:
– This tool .s main functions divided into 5 parts:
. Start tcpdump
. Stop tcpdump
. Run shell command
. Stop running shell command
. Clear log
It will cost long time after you stop the tool，
because the tool will auto full test , so Please wait.

Ftrace –Kernel Function Tracer
. Used to trace the kernel function at beginning
– It.s now an infrastructure that can be used for debugging or
analyzing latencies and performance issues in the kernel
. What this tool can help?
– Tracing kernel function, timing, context switch, interrupt latency,
events etc…
. Ftrace is framework for different tracers
– Auto inserted by compiler: Uses gcc .-pg. option
– Inserts call to .mcount. in each function prologue
. ARM platform implement in <arch/arm/kernel/entry-common.S>
. mcount must be called with a consistent stack frame and frame pointer. You can.t use “-fomit-
frame-pointers“ compiler option on ARM
– Compiler disables some optimizations automatically
– Can be used for debugging and profiling system behavior
. What.s the limitation?
– Enable it will add system overhead
– Basically, it.s a debugging tool, not a monitoring tool
2012/8/30 Copyright . MediaTek Inc. All rights reserved. 35MEDIATEK CONFIDENTIALFOR yuqing.zhang@ ck-telecom.com USE
Usage Scenario
. Ftrace has many tracers
– The most used “sched_switch“ tracer is default enabled on alps 2.3 (engineer mode)
. The “sched_switch“ tracer can be used for system behavior and performance
issue analysis
. Some possible scenario:
– Boot time analysis
– APP launch time analysis
– User scenario analysis
– Use the “sched_switch“ tracer to see the process flow based on time, and check if any
thing is blocked or taking too long to complete
. Start tracing
– adb shell “echo nop > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer“
– adb shell “echo 8192 > sys/kernel/debug/tracing/buffer_size_kb”
– adb shell “echo sched_switch > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer”
– adb shell “echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/tracing_enabled”
. Stop tracing and get the trace data
– adb shell “echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/tracing_enabled”
– adb pull /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace .

.同时使用GAT/mobile log会丢失大部分kernel log
–
do not use MobileLog and GAT(via USB mode) together! Or you will find
logs are divided by the two tools
.
MobileLog and GAT are both get Kernel Log through reading /proc/kmsg, which

Log Tool Using Scenarios (1/2)
.Mobile log tool and GAT use scenarios
-from the following figure It can be seen that the mobile log tool (device) and GAT (PC) capture the same
type of log. In short, because the mobile log is restricted by the system, it is impossible to capture
the log of some abnormal occasions (such as the moment before Hang machine, non-android environment such as factory
mode). In this case, GAT needs to be supplemented from the PC side –
Mobile log tool The feature is that it runs on the mobile phone and is easy to use (press start to start
), but the limitation is that the space of the mobile phone is limited –
mobile log tool later added BTlog, GAT cannot catch Btlog. GAT

.GAT capture log (must be able to connect to adb)
.UART4 link, and then enter logcat -v time to capture log (for USB plug-in operation)
. After finding the problem, capture the captured log and MTK_PULL_ALL.bat to capture the data Submit it together-
Hang machine problem
. Confirm Hang machine type
-connect to the mobile phone through usb/uart4, if uart4 is pulled out, uart4 is best.
Uart4: ps .USB
: adb shell ps
-if Uart4 has log spit out, the kernel is normal, if uart4/usb can perform command operations, that is, the upper screen hangs,
otherwise the entire system hangs
. The upper hang
– first dumps the state of the system.
adb shell dumpsys> dumpsys.txt
.adb shell dumpstate> dumpstate.txt
– Then use MTK_PULL_ALL.bat to capture the data and submit it together
-the most important point is to insert the USB and keep the scene. Inserting the USB is for the phone to continue to power on, and the scene cannot be kept if it is out of power

.The bottom layer of Hang live (77 has external WDT, so there will be no hang dead) – Submit the log captured by UART4 at the time. If not, please unplug the battery and restart after Hang live for 3 minutes (maybe the
log is still recording) , And then use UART4 + main log to reproduce
